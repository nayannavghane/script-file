#Starting and Stopping
• docker start • Starts a container, so it is running
• docker stop • Stops a running container
• docker restart • Stops and starts a container
• docker pause • Pauses a running container, “freezing” it in place
• docker unpause • Unpauses a running container
• docker wait • Blocks until running container stops
• docker kill • Sends a SIGKILL to a running container
• docker attach • Connects to a running container

#Information on Docker Containers, Processes and
Performance
• docker ps • Shows running containers
• docker logs • Gets logs from container; you can use a custom log driver, but logs are only
available for json-file and journald in 1.10
• docker inspect • Looks at all the info on a container (including IP address)
• docker events • Gets events from container
• docker port • Shows public facing port of container
• docker top • Shows running processes in container
• docker stats • Shows containers’ resource usage statistics
• docker diff • Shows changed files in the container’s filesystem
• docker ps -a • Shows running and stopped containers
• docker stats --all • Shows a running list of containers


#Import / Export (Backup / Restore)
• docker cp • Copies files or folders between a container and the local filesystem
• docker export • Turns container filesystem into tarball archive stream to STDOUT

#Executing Commands
• docker exec • Executes a command in container
To enter a running container, attach a new shell process to a running container called foo, use:
docker exec -it foo /bin/bash.

#Import a container as an image from file:
cat my_container.tar.gz | docker import - my_image•my_tag
Export an existing container:
docker export my_container > my_container.tar.gz

#Private and Public Registries/Repositories
A repository is a hosted collection of tagged images that, together, create the file system for a container.
A registry is a host -- a server that stores repositories and provides an HTTP API for managing the uploading
and downloading of repositories.
Docker.com hosts its own index to a central registry (the Docker Hub) which contains a large number of
repositories.
• docker login • Logs into a registry
• docker logout • Logs out from a registry
• docker search • Searches registry for image
• docker pull • Pulls an image from registry to local machine
• docker push • Pushes an image to the registry from local machine

#Dockerfile
The configuration file. Sets up a Docker container when you run docker build on it.
• Sections/Directives in a Dockerfile:
» .dockerignore • Files and directories to be ignored during the build -t of the
Dockerfile
» FROM • Sets the base image for subsequent instructions
» MAINTAINER • Sets the Author field of the generated images
» RUN • Executes any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commits the
results
» CMD • Provides defaults for an executing container
» EXPOSE • Informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at
